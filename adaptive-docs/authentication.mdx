## API Key Authentication

Adaptive uses API key authentication with Bearer tokens. You'll need to include your API key in the `Authorization` header for all requests.

## Getting Your API Key

1. Sign up at [llmadaptive.uk](https://adaptive.app)
2. Create a new project in your dashboard
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Generate a new API key

<Warning>
  Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code or public
  repositories.
</Warning>

## Using Your API Key

### In Headers

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://llmadaptive.uk/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-adaptive-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

### With OpenAI SDK

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: "your-adaptive-api-key",
  baseURL: "https://llmadaptive.uk/api/v1",
});
```

### Environment Variables

Store your API key in environment variables:

```bash
# .env
ADAPTIVE_API_KEY=your-adaptive-api-key
```

```javascript
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.ADAPTIVE_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "https://llmadaptive.uk/api/v1",
});
```

## API Key Permissions

API keys provide access to:

- Chat completions endpoint
- Model listing endpoint
- Usage analytics (for your account)

## Rate Limits

Rate limits are applied per API key:

- **Free Tier**: 100 requests per minute
- **Pro Tier**: 1,000 requests per minute
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits

## Error Responses

### Invalid API Key

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Invalid API key",
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "code": "invalid_api_key"
  }
}
```

### Rate Limit Exceeded

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded",
    "type": "rate_limit_error",
    "code": "rate_limit_exceeded"
  }
}
```
