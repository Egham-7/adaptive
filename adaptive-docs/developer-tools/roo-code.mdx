## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Connection Issues" icon="wifi-off">
**Problem**: Roo Code can't connect to Adaptive

**Solutions**:
- Verify your API key at [llmadaptive.uk/dashboard](https://www.llmadaptive.uk/dashboard)
- Check that Base URL is exactly: `https://www.llmadaptive.uk/api/v1`
- Restart VS Code after configuration changes
- Test API connection manually:
```bash
curl https://www.llmadaptive.uk/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-adaptive-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    "max_tokens": 100
  }'
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission Issues" icon="shield">
**Problem**: Roo Code can't access files or project structure

**Solutions**:
- **Check VS Code workspace trust**: Ensure the workspace is trusted
- **Review permission settings**: Enable file read/write permissions in Roo Code settings
- **Verify project access**: Grant project access permissions for full functionality
- **Check file permissions**: Ensure VS Code has permission to access project files
- **Restart extension**: Disable and re-enable Roo Code extension

**Permission Troubleshooting**:
```bash
# Check if VS Code can access the project directory
ls -la /path/to/your/project

# Verify file permissions
stat /path/to/your/project/package.json
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Authentication Errors" icon="key">
**Problem**: Invalid API key errors

**Solutions**:
- Regenerate your API key from the Adaptive dashboard
- Ensure you're using your Adaptive API key, not a direct provider key
- Check for extra spaces or characters in the API key field
- Verify the key format matches: `ada-...` (starts with ada-)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Performance Issues" icon="gauge">
**Problem**: Slow responses or timeouts during project analysis

**Solutions**:
- **Use intelligent routing**: Leave model name empty for optimal performance
- **Reduce project scope**: Focus analysis on specific directories or files
- **Check project size**: Very large projects may require longer processing time
- **Try faster models**: Use `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` for quicker responses
- **Optimize permissions**: Only enable necessary permissions to reduce overhead

**Performance Tips**:
- **Large projects**: Break analysis into smaller chunks
- **Complex analysis**: Allow extra time for comprehensive project reviews
- **Concurrent operations**: Avoid running multiple heavy analyses simultaneously

</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

### Optimal Configuration

<CodeGroup>
```json Recommended Settings
{
  "apiProvider": "openai-compatible",
  "baseUrl": "https://www.llmadaptive.uk/api/v1",
  "apiKey": "your-adaptive-api-key",
  "modelName": "",
  "permissions": {
    "fileRead": true,
    "fileWrite": true,
    "projectAccess": true,
    "autoApprove": false
  }
}
```

```json Performance Optimized
{
  "apiProvider": "openai-compatible",
  "baseUrl": "https://www.llmadaptive.uk/api/v1",
  "apiKey": "your-adaptive-api-key",
  "modelName": "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022",
  "maxTokens": 4096,
  "temperature": 0.1
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Security Considerations

- **API Key Security**: Store API keys securely, never commit to version control
- **Permission Granularity**: Only grant necessary permissions for your use case
- **Project Isolation**: Use separate configurations for different projects
- **Regular Key Rotation**: Rotate API keys periodically for enhanced security

### Workflow Integration

1. **Start with Project Analysis**: Begin new projects with comprehensive structure analysis
2. **Iterative Development**: Use Roo Code for continuous code improvement and refactoring
3. **Documentation Maintenance**: Regularly update documentation using Roo Code's capabilities
4. **Quality Assurance**: Leverage analysis features for code quality and security reviews
