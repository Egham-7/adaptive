Configure Kilo Code to use Adaptive's intelligent routing for 60-80% cost savings while maintaining the same AI-assisted development experience with MCP support.

<Tip>
**Save 60-80% on AI development costs** with intelligent model routing. Kilo Code's MCP support works seamlessly with Adaptive's API.
</Tip>

Kilo Code is a powerful VS Code extension that supports MCP (Model Context Protocol), enabling you to leverage AI models for efficient code development directly in your editor with extended capabilities.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Connection Issues" icon="wifi-off">
**Problem**: Kilo Code can't connect to Adaptive

**Solutions**:
- Verify your API key at [llmadaptive.uk/dashboard](https://www.llmadaptive.uk/dashboard)
- Check that Base URL is exactly: `https://www.llmadaptive.uk/api/v1`
- Restart VS Code after configuration changes
- Test API connection manually:
```bash
curl https://www.llmadaptive.uk/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-adaptive-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    "max_tokens": 100
  }'
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="MCP Server Issues" icon="server">
**Problem**: MCP servers not working or connecting

**Solutions**:
- **Check command paths**: Ensure `uv`, `npx`, or other commands are in your PATH
- **Verify server installation**: Install required MCP servers before configuring
- **Check permissions**: Ensure Kilo Code has permission to execute external commands
- **Review logs**: Check VS Code developer console for MCP-related error messages
- **Test server manually**: Run MCP server commands directly in terminal first

**Common MCP Installation Commands**:
```bash
# Install SQLite MCP server
pip install mcp-server-sqlite

# Install File System MCP server
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem

# Install Git MCP server
pip install mcp-server-git
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Authentication Errors" icon="key">
**Problem**: Invalid API key errors

**Solutions**:
- Regenerate your API key from the Adaptive dashboard
- Ensure you're using your Adaptive API key, not a direct provider key
- Check for extra spaces or characters in the API key field
- Verify the key format matches: `ada-...` (starts with ada-)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Model Selection Issues" icon="robot">
**Problem**: Specific models not working or slow responses

**Solutions**:
- **For intelligent routing**: Leave model name completely empty
- **For specific models**: Use standard model names without provider prefixes
- **Performance issues**: Try faster models like `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`
- **Check model availability**: Visit dashboard for current supported models

**Recommended Model Settings**:
- **General coding**: Leave empty for intelligent routing
- **Complex analysis**: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`
- **Quick responses**: `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`
- **Cost optimization**: `gpt-4o-mini`
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom MCP Server

Create your own MCP server for specific project needs:

```python
# Example custom MCP server (Python)
from mcp import Server
import json

server = Server("custom-project-server")

@server.tool("analyze_code_metrics")
def analyze_code_metrics(file_path: str) -> str:
    """Analyze code metrics for a given file."""
    # Your custom analysis logic here
    return json.dumps({"complexity": 5, "lines": 120})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    server.run()
```

### Workspace-Specific Configuration

Create workspace-specific settings for team consistency:

```json
// .vscode/settings.json
{
  "kilocode.apiProvider": "openai-compatible",
  "kilocode.baseUrl": "https://www.llmadaptive.uk/api/v1",
  "kilocode.modelName": "",
  "kilocode.mcpServers": {
    "ProjectDB": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "mcp-server-sqlite", "--db-path", "./project.db"]
    }
  }
}
```
