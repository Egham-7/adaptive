icon: "code"
---

Configure Cline VS Code extension to use Adaptive's intelligent LLM routing for significant cost savings while maintaining the same AI-assisted development experience.

<Tip>
**Save 60-80% on AI development costs** with intelligent model routing that automatically selects the optimal model for each coding task. Works as a drop-in replacement in your favorite VS Code AI assistant.
</Tip>

Cline is a powerful VS Code extension that allows you to directly use AI models in the editor for tasks such as code generation, file operations, debugging, and refactoring. With Adaptive's intelligent routing, you get the same powerful capabilities at a fraction of the cost.

## Get Your Adaptive API Key

Visit [llmadaptive.uk](https://www.llmadaptive.uk) to create an account and generate your API key from the dashboard.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Adaptive Configuration" icon="key">
    Fill in the configuration with the following settings:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```text Configuration Settings
    API Provider: OpenAI Compatible
    Base URL: https://www.llmadaptive.uk/api/v1
    API Key: your-adaptive-api-key-here
    Model: Use custom - leave empty for intelligent routing
    ```

    ```json Manual Configuration
    {
      "apiProvider": "openai-compatible",
      "baseUrl": "https://www.llmadaptive.uk/api/v1",
      "apiKey": "your-adaptive-api-key-here",
      "model": ""
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Advanced Settings (Optional)" icon="sliders">
    Adjust additional settings based on your preferences:
    - **Temperature**: 0.7 (default for balanced creativity)
    - **Max Tokens**: 4096 (or higher for complex tasks)
    - **Browser Use**: Uncheck if not needed
    - **Custom Instructions**: Add project-specific guidelines
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration Details

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="API Provider Settings" icon="server">
**Required Configuration:**
- **API Provider**: Select "OpenAI Compatible"
- **Base URL**: `https://www.llmadaptive.uk/api/v1`
- **API Key**: Your Adaptive API key from the dashboard
- **Model**: Leave empty for intelligent routing (recommended)

**Why OpenAI Compatible?**
Adaptive provides a fully compatible OpenAI API interface, allowing Cline to work seamlessly while benefiting from intelligent model routing and cost optimization.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Model Selection Options" icon="robot">
**Intelligent Routing (Recommended):**
- Leave the model field empty: `""`
- Adaptive automatically selects the optimal model for each task
- Provides the best cost/performance balance

**Custom Model Override:**
- `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` - High-performance coding
- `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` - Fast responses for simple tasks
- `gpt-4o` - Alternative high-performance option
- `gpt-4o-mini` - Cost-effective for basic tasks

**Format**: Use standard model names without provider prefixes when overriding.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Advanced Configuration" icon="wrench">
**Performance Tuning:**
```json
{
  "temperature": 0.1,        // Lower for more deterministic code
  "maxTokens": 8192,         // Higher for complex implementations
  "topP": 0.9,              // Nucleus sampling parameter
  "presencePenalty": 0.0,   // Repetition control
  "frequencyPenalty": 0.0   // Frequency control
}
```

**Custom Instructions Example:**
```text
Follow the project's TypeScript coding standards:
- Use ES modules (import/export)
- Prefer interface over type
- Include proper JSDoc comments
- Follow React 19 patterns
```
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Connection Issues" icon="wifi-off">
**Problem**: Cline can't connect to Adaptive

**Solutions**:
- Verify your API key at [llmadaptive.uk/dashboard](https://www.llmadaptive.uk/dashboard)
- Check that Base URL is exactly: `https://www.llmadaptive.uk/api/v1`
- Restart VS Code after configuration changes
- Test API key with curl:
```bash
curl https://www.llmadaptive.uk/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-adaptive-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
    "max_tokens": 100
  }'
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Authentication Errors" icon="key">
**Problem**: Invalid API key errors

**Solutions**:
- Regenerate your API key from the Adaptive dashboard
- Ensure you're using your Adaptive API key, not a direct provider key
- Check for extra spaces or characters in the API key field
- Verify the key format matches: `ada-...` (starts with ada-)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Model Selection Issues" icon="robot">
**Problem**: Want to use specific models or encountering model errors

**Solutions**:
- **For intelligent routing**: Leave model field completely empty
- **For specific models**: Use standard model names like `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`
- **Avoid provider prefixes**: Use `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`, not `anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`
- **Check model availability**: Visit dashboard for current supported models

**Supported Models**:
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Haiku
- GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5-turbo
- Gemini Pro, Gemini Flash
- And more - see [dashboard](https://www.llmadaptive.uk/dashboard) for full list
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Performance Issues" icon="gauge">
**Problem**: Slow responses or timeouts

**Solutions**:
- Check your internet connection
- Try reducing max_tokens for faster responses
- Use intelligent routing instead of specific heavy models
- Monitor usage on the [dashboard](https://www.llmadaptive.uk/dashboard) for any rate limits
- Consider using faster models like Claude 3.5 Haiku for simple tasks
