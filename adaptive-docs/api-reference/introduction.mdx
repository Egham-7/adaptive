## Welcome to Adaptive API

Adaptive provides an OpenAI-compatible API with intelligent model selection and cost optimization. Our API automatically routes requests to the optimal LLM for each task while maintaining full compatibility with existing OpenAI integrations.

## Key Features

- **ðŸ§  Smart Model Selection** - AI analyzes prompts and selects optimal models
- **ðŸ’° Cost Optimization** - Automatically routes to cheaper models when appropriate  
- **âš¡ OpenAI Compatible** - Drop-in replacement, just change the base URL
- **ðŸ”„ Multi-Provider** - OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, DeepSeek, Google AI, Grok, HuggingFace
- **ðŸ“Š Usage Analytics** - Track spending and optimization opportunities

## Base URL

```
https://llmadaptive.uk/api/v1
```

For local development:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. You must also have:
- **Valid API key** from your Adaptive dashboard
- **Active billing plan** or available free credits

### API Key Format

Include your API key in the `X-Stainless-API-Key` header:

```bash
curl https://api.adaptive.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "X-Stainless-API-Key: your-api-key-here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{...}'
```

## Error Handling

The API uses conventional HTTP response codes:

- **200** - Success
- **400** - Bad Request (invalid parameters)
- **401** - Unauthorized (invalid/missing API key)
- **402** - Payment Required (insufficient credits/billing not enabled)
- **429** - Rate Limit Exceeded
- **500** - Internal Server Error

Error responses include a JSON object with an `error` field:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid API key"
}
```

## Rate Limiting

API requests are limited to **1000 requests per minute** per API key. Rate limits are enforced using a sliding window algorithm.

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429` status code with this response:

```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "retry_after": "60 seconds"
}
```

## Adaptive Extensions

Beyond OpenAI compatibility, Adaptive adds powerful extensions:

### Provider Constraints
Limit model selection to specific providers:

```json
{
  "provider_constraint": ["openai", "anthropic"]
}
```

### Cost Bias
Control the cost vs performance trade-off:

```json
{
  "cost_bias": 0.3
}
```

- `0.0` = Maximum cost optimization
- `1.0` = Maximum performance optimization  
- `0.5` = Balanced (default)

### Enhanced Response Metadata
Responses include provider selection info and cost savings:

```json
{
  "choices": [...],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 42,
    "completion_tokens": 150,
    "total_tokens": 192,
    "cost_saved": 0.35
  },
  "provider": "openai",
  "model": "gpt-4o"
}
```

## SDKs and Libraries

Adaptive is compatible with all OpenAI SDKs. Simply change the base URL:

### Python (OpenAI SDK)
```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="your-adaptive-api-key",
    base_url="https://api.adaptive.ai/v1"
)
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript
```javascript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: 'your-adaptive-api-key',
  baseURL: 'https://api.adaptive.ai/v1'
});
```

### cURL
```bash
curl https://api.adaptive.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "X-Stainless-API-Key: your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "adaptive",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

## Getting Started

1. **Get an API key** from your [Adaptive dashboard](https://dashboard.adaptive.ai)
2. **Set up billing** or check your free credit balance
3. **Make your first request** using the examples above
4. **Monitor usage** and cost savings in your dashboard
