TECHNICAL DETAILS:
==================
- Dataset streamed directly from HuggingFace
- No local files created for dataset
- Real-time testing of adaptive_ai service
- HTTP requests to /predict endpoint
- Service running on port 8000

RECOMMENDATIONS:
================
1. Monitor response times under load
2. Implement service health monitoring
3. Add request queuing for high traffic
4. Track model performance over time
5. Consider load balancing for scaling
