Let's analyze the code snippet:

```javascript
() => device.gatt.getPrimaryService('health_thermometer')
```

This is an arrow function with no parameters that, when invoked, calls `device.gatt.getPrimaryService('health_thermometer')`.

**Understanding the method:**

- `device.gatt.getPrimaryService()` is a method in the Web Bluetooth API.
- It returns a `Promise<BluetoothRemoteGATTService>`.

**Type of the expression:**

- The arrow function itself has a return type of `Promise<BluetoothRemoteGATTService>`.

---

### In WebIDL terms:

- The function type can be described as:

```webidl
() => Promise<BluetoothRemoteGATTService>
```

or, more explicitly:

```webidl
typedef () => Promise<BluetoothRemoteGATTService> ServiceGetter;
```

### Summary:

- **Variable type (the function):** `() => Promise<BluetoothRemoteGATTService>`

- **Return type of the function:** `Promise<BluetoothRemoteGATTService>`

---

**Note:** If you are defining this function as a variable in WebIDL, it would be:

```webidl
typedef () => Promise<BluetoothRemoteGATTService> ServiceGetter;
```

or directly as a callback type:

```webidl
callback ServiceGetter = () => Promise<BluetoothRemoteGATTService>;
```

**In conclusion:**

The variable representing this function is of type:

```webidl
() => Promise<BluetoothRemoteGATTService>
```

Given:
- Three equal squares
- Sum of their perimeters = 36 cm

Step 1: Find the side length of one square.

Let the side length of each square be \( s \) cm.

Perimeter of one square = \( 4s \)

Sum of perimeters of three squares = \( 3 \times 4s = 12s \)

Given:
\[
12s = 36
\]

Divide both sides by 12:
\[
s = \frac{36}{12} = 3 \text{ cm}
\]

So, each square has a side length of 3 cm.

---

Step 2: Form a rectangle using the three squares.

If we place the three squares side by side, the rectangle formed will have:

- Length = \( 3 \times s = 3 \times 3 = 9 \) cm
- Width = \( s = 3 \) cm

---

Step 3: Find the area and perimeter of this rectangle.

Area:
\[
\text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 9 \times 3 = 27 \text{ cm}^2
\]

Perimeter:
\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2(\text{length} + \text{width}) = 2(9 + 3) = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ cm}
\]

---

**Final answer:**

- Area of the rectangle = \(27 \text{ cm}^2\)
- Perimeter of the rectangle = \(24 \text{ cm}\)

In Python, you can append multiple items to a list using several methods. Below are the most common approaches with code examples and outputs:

### 1. Using `extend()` Method
The `extend()` method adds all elements of an iterable (list, tuple, string, etc.) to the end of the list.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
new_items = [4, 5, 6]
my_list.extend(new_items)
print(my_list)
```
**Output:**
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

### 2. Using `+=` Operator
The `+=` operator can also be used to concatenate lists.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
new_items = [4, 5, 6]
my_list += new_items
print(my_list)
```
**Output:**
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

### 3. Using `append()` in a Loop
If you need to append items one by one (e.g., conditionally), use a loop with `append()`.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
new_items = [4, 5, 6]
for item in new_items:
    my_list.append(item)
print(my_list)
```
**Output:**
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

### Key Differences:
- `extend()` and `+=` add all items at once.
- `append()` in a loop is useful for conditional or iterative appending.

Choose the method that best fits your use case!
