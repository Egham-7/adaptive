Statement 1 is true. A ring homomorphism is one-to-one if and only if its kernel is {0}. This is a fundamental result in ring theory.

Statement 2 is not given enough information to determine its truth. While it is true that Q is an ideal in R (where Q is the set of rational numbers and R is the set of real numbers), the problem does not specify the context or the specific ring R, so we cannot definitively say that Q is an ideal in R without additional information.",True,8.067824125289917,Qwen/Qwen3-8B-Base,huggingface,huggingface/Qwen/Qwen3-8B-Base,0.5836560790747303,118,126,244,math,ori_mmlu-abstract_algebra,,9,pro,huggingface/Qwen/Qwen3-8B-Base,True,2025-07-26T11:57:57.169280
